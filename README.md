# Home Assistant Real-Time NBA Games Card
A Home Assistant frontend custom card that will display real-time updates for NBA teams tracked with the [ha-teamtracker](https://github.com/vasqued2/ha-teamtracker) integration by @vasqued2.  
This card was strongly based on the fantastic [ha-nfl-card](https://github.com/D34DC3N73R/ha-nfl-card) by @D34DC3N73R.
