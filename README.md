# Home Assistant Real-Time Sports Score Card
A Home Assistant frontend custom card that will display real-time updates for NBA teams tracked with the [ha-teamtracker](https://github.com/vasqued2/ha-teamtracker) integration by @vasqued2.  

This card was strongly based on the fantastic [ha-nfl-card](https://github.com/D34DC3N73R/ha-nfl-card) by @D34DC3N73R.

#### Version Compatibility
 - Releases for [ha-teamtracker](https://github.com/vasqued2/ha-teamtracker) and [ha-teamtracker-card](https://github.com/vasqued2/ha-teamtracker-card) will follow the MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH convention.
 - All teamtracker and teamtracker-card releases with the same MAJOR and MINOR version numbers will be compatible, regardless of PATCH version.
 - For example, any teamtracker v0.2.x will be compatible with any teamtracker-card v0.2.y.
 - Compatibility is not guaranteed across MAJOR or MINOR version numbers.
